As the two were walking up Geary Boulevard nearing Webster, they were passed by a black man, who then turned around and stopped, and then proceeded to shoot both cadets in their backs twice with his .32 caliber gun as they attempted to run.  The two bullets that hit Story, hit her in the waist (missing her spine), causing her to collapse to the ground, and resulting in the third bullet subsequently missing her altogether. Rainwater died, but Story survived the ordeal.  No nearby witnesses, nor Story, were able to identify the perpetrators, but police officers believe this was yet another attack by the Zebra killers.

Officer Wayne Rhatigan, a member of the New York Police Department's mounted division, was alerted by the vendor and then approached the vehicle and looked inside, where he spotted a box that was smoking and was able to smell gunpowder. The NYPD Bomb Squad was called to the scene, where they deployed a robotic device to break the SUV's back windows and to observe what was inside the vehicle. In the vehicle, police discovered the following: three 20-gallon propane canisters; two five-gallon cans of gasoline; 40+ consumer-grade M-88 firecrackers that had been placed inside of a 20-ounce metal container that had been wrapped in duct tape; a 55-inch by 32-inch green metal locker that contained eight plastic bags that held a total of approximately 250 pounds of Urea based fertilizer, a metal pressure cooker pot containing wires and an additional 120 M-88 firecrackers.
